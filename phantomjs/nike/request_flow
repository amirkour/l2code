- jquery parsing for link X
- there are example htmls.  
  - in 1.html search for text "The Air Jordan 4 Retro ‘Fire Red’ is now available"
  - in 2.html search for text "KD VI is now available"

http get link X
- this might be a post, and it might include a redirect to a new page ...
  - print the http status results from this request
- you should probably detect "sold out at nike.com" if you can, otherwise execution from here down will just fail
- size selection pulldown
- add to cart button
  - there's some JS that shows a pulldown at this point.  it has a 'checkout' button you might be able to hit
  - otherwise, you need to just find/hit the normal checkout button
- where do sessions fit into this?
