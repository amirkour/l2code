mongooz provides quick-n-easy mongo hashes: CRUD ops on the ruby mongo driver in the form of a HashWithIndifferentAccess.

class CoolClass < Mongooz::MongoozHash
end

a=CoolClass.new
a[:foo]='bar'
a.db_save

you now have a collection called 'coolclass' in the 'test' mongo database being hosted on localhost:27017.  you can change that like so:

Mongooz.defaults :db=>'cooldb', :host=>'coolhost', :port=>123123
a.db_save

now you have a collection called 'coolclass' in the 'cooldb' mongo databased being hosted on coolhost:123123.
